				HTML is an acronym for Hypertext Markup Language, which is the language we have used to
				create webpages since the first webpages arrived on the web. HTML roots are from an older
				markup language that was used in document publishing, called SGML (Standard Generalized
				Markup Language).
				One interesting aspect of HTML and its relationship with browsers was that browsers were
				designed to be backward compatible and forward compatible. Creating a browser that is
				backward compatible is relatively easy because the problem domain is known, but how is
				forward compatibility accomplished? Browsers were created to ignore tags that they didn't
				recognize.

				Although HTML served its purpose for quite some time, people wanted more. Another
				evolving technology, called XML (eXtensible Markup Language), was becoming popular. XML
				looks a lot like HTML because both languages use tags. However, there are several big differences.
				First, XML always requires matching end tags for every tag, although you can use
				a shortcut notation to denote a starting tag and ending tag together. Another difference is
				that HTML has a very specific set of tag names, and each of these tags denotes a formatting
				feature that is to be applied to the rendered webpage. XML doesnâ€™t have a defined set of tag
				names, so you create your own tag names, and the tags can represent anything.
